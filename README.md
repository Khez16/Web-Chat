A: Project is a Chatroom that can message other people.The user can switch between chatrooms and chat with other people. One of the features is that upon switching rooms the old messages get removed and the title changes. Users can even make their own username. Finally they are able to switch between the about page and the main page.
B: One of the main things that I focused on is improvements on the webpage design, including the titles, allowing different colours, and adding buttons. I also added features such as adding rooms, and we wanted to improve our UI, such as the titlepage and aesthetics.
C: First the user can clone the project into their repository by visiting the link, and using their git bash. Then they must open the file in Intellij, make sure they are using Java SDK 21. They can then run the project chatServer.java through src/main/java/com.example.webchatserver/CharRoom.java. From there they can set up the configurations, and run the project.
